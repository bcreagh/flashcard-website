# Flashcard website

This is a simple website for helping me with my studies. 

The idea is very basic. I have prepared a number of revision questions based on topics that I need to know about. This website displays those questions, gives me a chance to remember the answer and then reveals the correct answer when I am ready.

The questions and answers are retrieved from a REST API. This repository only contains the frontend code. It does not include the code for the REST API.
